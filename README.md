# beckerlabs - My portfolio website
This repository contains my (pretty barebones) portfolio website.
I've created a number of these over the years, but this is the
first one to use Golang as the backend.

## Technologies Used

### [Golang](https://go.dev/)
This drives the backend of the website.  Golang is great and
it's pretty ubiquitous in the DevOps landscape, so it makes
sense for me.

### [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template)
Just the regular old HTML templating package for Go. Nothing
too fancy here, but this is a simple page so it makes sense to use.

### [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
I have a confession... CSS is like black magic to me at times.
Tailwind makes it easy for me to make the webpage _almost_ have
a cohesive design.  Plus, I like the concept of only writing HTML.

### [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
Probably one of the easiest relational databases to set up and use.
This is really only used to store my blog posts.
