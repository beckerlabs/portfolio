# beckerlabs - My portfolio website
This repository contains my (pretty barebones) portfolio website.
I've created a number of these over the years, but this is the
first one to use Golang as the backend.  This webpage includes
some blog posts, which are written with Markdown and rendered
into HTML.

## Technologies Used

### [Golang](https://go.dev/)
This drives the backend of the website.  Golang is great and
it's pretty ubiquitous in the DevOps landscape, so it makes
sense for me.

### [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template)
Just the regular old HTML templating package for Go. Nothing
too fancy here, but this is a simple page so it makes sense to use.
