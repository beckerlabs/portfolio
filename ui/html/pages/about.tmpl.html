                <p >Hey there -  I'm Jeremy Becker.  My professional title is a DevOps engineer but I'd describe myself as a generalist.  I write code, build infrastructure and operate it at scale.</p>
                <h3 >Education and Experience</h3>
                <p>I have a Computer Science Degree from Purdue Fort Wayne with a focus in Software Engineering and I spend a lot of my free time writing code.  Some of my favorite languages are Golang, .NET, Java and Python. My ops background has also blessed me with lots of bash and PowerShell experience. I've used an ever-growing list of tools in my day to day work which includes Kubernetes, Helm, Flux, Splunk, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible and so much more.</p>
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>When not focusing on tech, I love to spend time with family, lift weights and watch sports.</p>
                <h3>Homelab</h3>
                <p>I also have a small homelab as a way to get my hands on technology that sounds interesting.  The server was given to me by a former employer and I've made good use of the humble machine.  Here's the quick specs: Dell PowerEdge T20, Intel Xeon E3-1225 v3 @ 3.20GHz, 32GB DDR3 and 480GB SSD.
                
                The server is constantly changing, but at the time of this writing it's a Fedora 41 box that's running a single node Kubernetes cluster.  I'm using <a >Tailscale Kubernetes Operator</a> to reach them from devices on my Tailnet.</p>
