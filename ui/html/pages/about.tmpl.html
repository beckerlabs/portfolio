    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey there -  I'm Jeremy Becker.  I'm a DevOps engineer who loves to speed up releases while maintaining quality and making developer's lives easier.  I've worked in various roles over my 8 year technology career spanning finance and quick service restaurants.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have a Computer Science Degree from Purdue Fort Wayne with a focus in Software Engineering and I spend a lot of my free time writing code.  Some of my favorite languages are Golang, .NET, Java and Python.  My experience in DevOps also means I've scripting languages such as PowerShell and Bash extensively. I've used an ever-growing list of tools in my day to day work which includes Kubernetes, Helm, Flux, Splunk, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible and so much more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I'm not focused on tech you can usually catch me lifting weights, playing video games, reading a good book or spending time with loved ones.</p>
