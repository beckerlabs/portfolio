            <h2>Welcome to BeckerLabs.dev!</h2>
            <p>Hey there - my name is Jeremy Becker.  Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I fiddle with any technology that I find fun and interesting.  That's mostly Golang recently, which drives this website.</p>
            <br>If you want more information about me, please visit the <a href="/about"> about page.</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes I also write blog posts or short thoughts.  If you want to read disjointed, poorly written thoughts, you can find those below.</p>
